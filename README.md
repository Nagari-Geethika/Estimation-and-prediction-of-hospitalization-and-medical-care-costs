This project analyzes and predicts medical care costs based on patient demographics and health factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, gender, and region. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, dashboards, and predictive insights.

Tech Stack

Python,
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,
IBM Cognos / Power BI,
Flask (for web integration)


**Key Features**

Data cleaning and preprocessing,
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
Interactive dashboards and reports,
Insights on healthcare cost drivers,
Web-based visualization integration.

**Insights**

Smoking and age significantly increase medical charges,
Southeast region shows higher BMI and charges,
Elderly patients (60+) have unusually high hospitalization costs,
BMI shows weak positive correlation with age.

**Future Enhancements**

Machine learning model for cost prediction,
Deployment on AWS/Azure,
Real-time healthcare analytics dashboard# Estimation-and-Prediction-of-Hospitalization-and-Medical-Care-Costs

Hi, I'm Geethika, an aspiring Data Analyst. I would love to break down complex data topics into simple, practical content and extract the insights from them for the business development.

Thanks for checking out project.
